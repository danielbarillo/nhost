title: "Enabling Service"
---

You can enable the AI service with the following steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="First Step">
    Check your project's settings and make sure the database version is at least `14.6-20231018-1`. If it isn't upgrade your database version (latest available version is recommended).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Second Step">
    Create a migration with the following SQL code (if you aren't working with migrations you can apply the SQL directly in the database tab):
    ```sql
    -- AI service data will be stored in this schema
    CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS graphite;
    SET ROLE postgres;
    -- We need this extension to store and work with embeddings
    CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
    -- This extension is used to be able to call the AI service to
    -- generate embeddings directly from a postgres function
    CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS http;
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Third Step">
    Get an OpenAI API key from their [customer portal](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fourth Step">
    Finally, you can head to your project's settings -> AI section and enable the service or, alternatively, use your TOML configuration file to enable the service (you need to use the TOML to enable it for use in the local CLI):

        ```toml
        [ai]
        # Version of the service to use.
        version = '0.1.0'

        # Used to validate requests between postgres and the AI service.
        # The AI service will also include the header X-Graphite-Webhook-Secret
        # with this value set when calling external webhooks so the source of
        # the request can be validated.
        webhookSecret = '{{ secrets.GRAPHITE_WEBHOOK_SECRET }}'

        [ai.autoEmbeddings]
        # How often to run the job that keeps embeddings up to date
        synchPeriodMinutes = 5

        [ai.openai]
        # Key to use for authenticating API requests to OpenAI.
        apiKey = '{{ secrets.OPEANAI_API_KEY }}'
        # OpenAI organization to use.
        organization = 'my-org'

        [ai.resources.compute]
        # Dedicated resources allocated for the service
        cpu = 125
        memory = 256
        ```
      </Tab>
