This reference section is home to both backend services and the various client libraries available. 

## Backend Services

In this section you can find all available endpoints to both the authentication and storage services. This section ships with an **API Playground** to help you learn and test the endpoints against a local Nhost instance.

Both servides expose REST APIs that you can interact with as long as the right credentials are provided. Examples for multiple languages are available.

To learn how to start a local Nhost instance check out [local development](/development/cli/overview). Starting a local instance is optional and only required if you want to use the playground to simulate real requests.

## Client Libraries

This section documents the API for all available client libraries:

- `@nhost/nhost-js`
- `@nhost/react`
- `@nhost/nextjs`
- `@nhost/vue`
