All Nhost projects have their own dedicated PostgreSQL instance, an advanced, open-source object-relational database system known for its robustness, durability, and performance. 

With a history of over 30 years of active development, PostgreSQL offers a versatile solution for managing data in a wide range of applications, from web services to data warehousing.

## Your database like a spreadsheet

Manage your database through the Nhost Dashboard. Create tables, relationships, manage data, and more, with a simple but powerful UI.

### Extensions

Extensions are one of Postgres' best features because they allow us to extend the functionality of our databases. 

Nhost supports a bunch of extensions that you can install to add functionalities such as full-text search capabilities with pgvector or implement geographic object support with PostGIS. 

You can find the complete list of supported extensions [here](http://localhost:3000/guides/database/extensions).
