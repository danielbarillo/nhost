Nhost Functions are server-side JS/TS functions that can be used with Event Triggers to create async workflows, as well as to integrate with external service providers like Stripe or Slack.

Functions run on AWS Lambda and scale as needed, without you having to think of infrastructure.

## Write

```ts
import { Request, Response } from 'express'

export default (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.status(200).send(`Hello ${req.query.name}!`)
}
```

Write simple functions, we take care of the rest.

## Deploy

Deploy functions as part of your project. Simply drop your code inside `./functions`.

Functions are deployed as part of a [Deployment](/platform/deployments).

### Nhost Run

For more sophisticated use-cases and control over the runtime, use [Nhost Run](/product/run).
