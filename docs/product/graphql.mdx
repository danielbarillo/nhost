Instant and autogenerated APIs for all your data. 

Hasura is a powerful GraphQL engine that generates **realtime GraphQL APIs** from a PostgreSQL database. 

With Hasura, we transform your PostgreSQL data into realtime APIs without the need for complex backend logic.

All your data is instantly available through the API, as soon as it is added to your database. Let's say we have a `todos` table with columns `id`, `title`, and `completed`. The following query would work without writing a single line of code:

```graphql
query GetTodos {
  todos {
    id
    title
    completed
  }
}
```

### GraphQL Clients

The Nhost JavaScript SDK ships with a simple GraphQL client that you can use for simple operations. Nhost is agnostic regarding the client you choose and works well with many clients:

- Apollo Client
- URQL
- React Query
- SWR
- etc
